# shell

`Shell` refers to a program that provides a command-line interface for interacting with an operating system. In this project I have worked on a `POSIX compliant shell` that's capable of interpreting shell commands, running external programs and builtin commands.
# Set Up 

This setup was tested on Arch Linux.

1. Install the required compiler,

```shell
  sudo pacman -S gcc
```
2. Compile `shell`

```shell
  git clone https://github.com/hissamshar/shell.git shell
  cd shell
  make
```
